## Technical Implementation

This website is built with:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

It's designed to be hosted on GitHub Pages with no backend requirements. The news feed is static and would need to be updated via GitHub Actions in a real implementation.

## Deployment Instructions

1. Fork this repository
2. Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings (Settings â†’ Pages)
3. Select the main branch as the source
4. Your site will be available at `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name/`

## Implementation Notes

In a production environment, you would:

1. Create a GitHub Action that runs daily to fetch fresh news from the sources
2. Parse the content and update the news-data.js file
3. Commit and push the changes automatically
4. This would keep your news feed updated daily without requiring a backend server

## File Structure

- `index.html` - Main HTML structure
- `styles.css` - CSS styling
- `news-data.js` - Contains the news articles data
- `app.js` - JavaScript functionality for filtering and displaying news
